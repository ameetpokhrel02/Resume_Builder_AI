This project is a full-stack AI-powered resume builder. It contains a Django backend (with DRF, JWT, and OpenAI integration) and a Vite+React+TypeScript+Tailwind frontend. Follow best practices for both Django REST APIs and modern React SPAs. All code should be placed in the appropriate 'backend' or 'frontend' subfolder.
